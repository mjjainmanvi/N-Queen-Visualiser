# N-Queen Visualiser

- The N-Queen Visualizer is a project designed to help users understand and explore the N-Queens problem through visualization. The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Here's the demo below:
